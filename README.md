# SAT4
Created a project with a classmate Taylor Griffen in a paired programming environment. This was remote teamwork using technologies like: Discord, Zoom, GitHub, MySQL, Visual Studio, ASP.NET MVC. We completed this project as a study for AGILE and SCRUM methodology. We adhered to a KanBan board (Trello) and used joint acess to this repo so we could collaborate.
